## Introduction {.unnumbered}

This research relies on molecular clock methods to estimate substitution rates and divergence times in *Human adenovirus* samples. This requires a highly curated data set of time-stamped, homologous, nucleic acid sequences representative of a measurably evolving population [@drummondMeasurablyEvolvingPopulations2003]. Thus, a preprocessing workflow is necessary to extract and normalize sampling date information. The presence of heterogeneous or ambiguous date formats is a complicating factor and a time sink. Also, the task becomes intractable for manual execution as the number of samples increases. As a result, this research defines a generic workflow and automated, parallel pipeline that coordinates the execution or preprocessing and analytical tasks in a reproducible manner.

## Methods {.unnumbered}

This section documents an executable pipeline that constructs data sets for molecular clock analysis. The solution relies on Snakemake, which is a portable, rule-based workflow engine [@kosterSnakemakeScalableBioinformatics2012]. Configurable rules define jobs that can optionally run within environments defined with the Conda package manager. The engine automatically infers the workflow execution path and parallelization based on input dependencies, creating a directed acyclic graph [@kosterSnakemakeScalableBioinformatics2012]. Accordingly, the engine guarantees the reproducibility of each step.
