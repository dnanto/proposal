## Introduction {.unnumbered}

This research relies on molecular clock methods to estimate substitution rates and divergence times in *Human adenovirus* samples. This requires a highly curated data set of time-stamped, homologous, nucleic acid sequences representative of a measurably evolving population [@drummondMeasurablyEvolvingPopulations2003]. Thus, a preprocessing workflow is necessary to exract and normalize sampling date information. The presence of heterogeneous or ambiguous date formats is a complicating factor and a time sink. Also, the task becomes intractable for manual execution as the number of samples increases. As a result, this research defines a generic workflow and automated, parallel pipeline that coordinates the execution or preprocessing and analytical tasks in a reproducible manner.
