## Introduction {.unnumbered}

This research relies on molecular clock methods to estimate substitution rates and divergence times in *Human adenovirus* samples. This requires a highly curated data set of homologous nucleic acid sequences with collection date time-stamps to represent a measurably evolving population [@drummondMeasurablyEvolvingPopulations2003]. Manual execution of this workflow becomes intractable as the number of samples increases. The presence of heterogeneous or ambiguous date formats adds another time sink. This research defines a generic workflow and automated, parallel pipeline that coordinates the execution in a reproducible manner.
