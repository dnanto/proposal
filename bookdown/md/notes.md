# objectives
* analyze adenovirus genomes of type >= 52
* create a tool that downloads sequence metadata from NCBI
* create a tool that clusters sequence alignments
* create a tool that performs dynamic root-to-tip divergence calculations

# questions
* limit host to human?
* limit to mastadenovirus?
* are there any mislabled types >= 52 in NCBI other than 11a?
* what should be the representative genome? (currently using 55)
* should the research ignore sequences without collection dates?
