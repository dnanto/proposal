  abstract = {A collection of 165 adenovirus strains isolated from nasopharyngeal aspirates of children hospitalized for acute lower respiratory infection in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay between 1991 and 1994 was studied by restriction enzyme analysis (work performed in the Department of Virology, University of Ume{\aa}). Of the isolates, 71\% (n = 117) were identified as members of subgenus B. Of these, 101 (61.2\%) corresponded to genome type 7h, four (2.4\%) to genome type 3p2, four (2.4\%) to genome type 11a, one (0.6\%) to genome type 7b, and one (0.6\%) to genome type 7c. Two isolates that were neutralized as serotype 3 and four isolates that were neutralized as serotype 7 exhibited novel BamHI cleavage profiles corresponding to three new genome types denominated 3x, 7i, and 7j. Subgenus C members represented 28.5\% of all typed isolates. Five different genome types of Ad1, seven genome types of Ad2, and three genome types of Ad5 were identified of, which two, two, and one, respectively, were found to correspond to new DNA variants. Only one isolate (0.6\%) corresponded to Ad4 of subgenus E. Ad7h was isolated from 17 of the 18 fatal cases recorded among the patients included in the study. \textcopyright{} 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Species Human mastadenovirus E (HAdV-E) comprises several simian types and a single human type: HAdV-E4, a respiratory and ocular pathogen. RFLP analysis for the characterization of intratypic genetic variability has previously distinguished two HAdV-E4 clusters: prototype (p)-like and a-like. Our analysis of whole genome sequences confirmed two distinct lineages, which we refer to as phylogroups (PGs). PGs I and II comprise the p- and a-like genomes, respectively, and differ significantly in their G~+~C content (57.7\%~{$\pm{}~$}0.013 vs 56.3\%~{$\pm{}~$}0.015). Sequence differences distinguishing the two clades map to several regions of the genome including E3 and ITR. Bayesian analyses showed that the two phylogroups diverged approximately 602 years before the present. A relatively faster evolutionary rate was identified for PG II. Our data provide a rationale for the incorporation of phylogroup identity to HAdV-E4 strain designation to reflect the identified unique genetic characteristics that distinguish PGs I and II.},

  abstract = {In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate to a new field of ``relaxed phylogenetics.'' Here we introduce a new approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution.},
