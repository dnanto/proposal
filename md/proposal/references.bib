  abstract = {A collection of 165 adenovirus strains isolated from nasopharyngeal aspirates of children hospitalized for acute lower respiratory infection in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay between 1991 and 1994 was studied by restriction enzyme analysis (work performed in the Department of Virology, University of Ume{\aa}). Of the isolates, 71\% (n = 117) were identified as members of subgenus B. Of these, 101 (61.2\%) corresponded to genome type 7h, four (2.4\%) to genome type 3p2, four (2.4\%) to genome type 11a, one (0.6\%) to genome type 7b, and one (0.6\%) to genome type 7c. Two isolates that were neutralized as serotype 3 and four isolates that were neutralized as serotype 7 exhibited novel BamHI cleavage profiles corresponding to three new genome types denominated 3x, 7i, and 7j. Subgenus C members represented 28.5\% of all typed isolates. Five different genome types of Ad1, seven genome types of Ad2, and three genome types of Ad5 were identified of, which two, two, and one, respectively, were found to correspond to new DNA variants. Only one isolate (0.6\%) corresponded to Ad4 of subgenus E. Ad7h was isolated from 17 of the 18 fatal cases recorded among the patients included in the study. \textcopyright{} 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Species Human mastadenovirus E (HAdV-E) comprises several simian types and a single human type: HAdV-E4, a respiratory and ocular pathogen. RFLP analysis for the characterization of intratypic genetic variability has previously distinguished two HAdV-E4 clusters: prototype (p)-like and a-like. Our analysis of whole genome sequences confirmed two distinct lineages, which we refer to as phylogroups (PGs). PGs I and II comprise the p- and a-like genomes, respectively, and differ significantly in their G~+~C content (57.7\%~{$\pm{}~$}0.013 vs 56.3\%~{$\pm{}~$}0.015). Sequence differences distinguishing the two clades map to several regions of the genome including E3 and ITR. Bayesian analyses showed that the two phylogroups diverged approximately 602 years before the present. A relatively faster evolutionary rate was identified for PG II. Our data provide a rationale for the incorporation of phylogroup identity to HAdV-E4 strain designation to reflect the identified unique genetic characteristics that distinguish PGs I and II.},

  abstract = {In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate to a new field of ``relaxed phylogenetics.'' Here we introduce a new approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution.},

In studies undertaken from 1965 to 1970, live adenovirus type 4 and subsequently type 7 vaccines were found to be safe and immunogenic and to confer protection against type specific adenovirus ARD. For the past 5 yr. military trainees have been immunized with both adenovirus vaccines during periods of expected adenovirus disease. Since 1966, use of adenovirus vaccines has been monitored through the adenovirus surveillance program which yields weekly data on incidence and etiology of ARD in basic combat trainees. Since 1973, stable adenovirus vaccines have resulted in excellent control of adenovirus ARD. Potential problems with this immunization program are discussed.},

Its genome encodes a domain of the major capsid protein, hexon, from HAdV-B16 recombined into the genome chassis of a simian adenovirus. Genomes of two recent field strains provide a clue to its adaptation to the new host: recombination of a NF-I binding site motif, which is required for efficient viral replication, from another HAdV genome. This motif is absent in the chimpanzee adenoviruses and the HAdV-E4 prototype, but is conserved amongst other HAdVs. This is the first report of an interspecies recombination event for HAdVs, and the first documentation of a lateral partial gene transfer from a chimpanzee AdV. The potential for such recombination events are important when considering chimpanzee adenoviruses as candidate gene delivery vectors for human patients.},

In 2001 we encountered nosocomial infections with epidemic conjunctivitis in the ophthalmology ward of one hospital in Sapporo, which is in the northern part of Japan. Adenoviruses were isolated from the patients with this nosocomial infection and identified as adenovirus type 4 (AdV-4) by a neutralization test with serotype-specific antiserum. When the cleavage patterns of the isolates were compared with the full viral genome with BamHI and SmaI, the cleavage patterns of the isolates were shown to be different from those of AdV-4p and other previously known AdV-4 variants. The nucleotide sequences of the fiber gene of the isolates showed the highest homologies (94.3\%) with AdV-4 among the nucleotide sequences available from GenBank and formed a monophyletic cluster along with the prototype strain of AdV-4. The isolates, however, were located in a different lineage from those of AdV-4p and the AdV-4 variant from the sporadic infections. We conclude that the nosocomial infection that appeared in 2001 was caused by a new genome type of AdV-4, which was designated AdV-4c.},

Adenovirus serotypes 4 and 7 have caused outbreaks of self-limited febrile respiratory illness in young adults in basic military training. During the 1950s and 1960s, up to 10\% of recruits were infected with adenovirus, and these pathogens were responsible for approximately 90\% of pneumonia hospitalizations. Beginning in 1971, all military recruits received oral, live, enteric-coated vaccines that were licensed by the Food and Drug Administration as safe and effective in preventing illness from adenovirus serotypes 4 and 7. In 1996, the sole manufacturer ceased production of adenoviral vaccines and, as supplies dwindled during the next few years, outbreaks of adenoviral respiratory illness reemerged in military settings. Since 1999, approximately 10\%-12\% of all recruits have become ill with adenovirus infection in basic training, similar to the prevaccine era. This report describes the first two deaths probably associated with adenovirus infection identified in military recruits since the vaccines became unavailable. The military has requested proposals for a new adenovirus vaccine manufacturer; however, these deaths suggest that efforts by policymakers and pharmaceutical companies to reestablish adenoviral vaccine production should be intensified.},

  abstract = {Among the 53 serotypes of human adenoviruses (HAdVs), identified to date, only a limited number have been associated with human respiratory infections. The epidemiology of each of the serotypes differs depending on the location and/or time of surveillance. This study was performed to elucidate the epidemiology of HAdV respiratory infections by comprehensive serotyping of the HAdVs isolated from the respiratory tract of Korean children. HAdVs isolated from respiratory specimens of Korean children over 17 consecutive years (1991-2007) were typed by the neutralization test or molecular methods, including two-sets of multiplex PCR assays, and/or sequence analysis of the hexon gene. From January 1991 through December 2007, a total of 741 isolates were obtained from nasal aspirates of children hospitalized or requiring medical treatment in the emergency room. All isolates were type-determined successfully and 13 different serotypes were identified, which included HAdV serotypes 1-8, 11, 19, 34, 37, and 41. HAdV-3 (n = 285, 37.7\%) and HAdV-7 (n = 181, 23.9\%) were the predominant serotypes; HAdV-8, -11, -19, -34, -37, and -41 were not usually associated with respiratory diseases. HAdV-3 was present both during outbreaks and in sporadic cases. HAdV-7 emerged in a very large outbreak, followed by smaller outbreaks. HAdV-1, -2, -4, -5, and -6 were isolated sporadically throughout the study period. In conclusion, a total of 13 different serotypes of HAdV were detected among Korean children with respiratory tract infections. HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 were the most common serotypes, and they were associated with HAdV outbreaks.},

  abstract = {From November 1999 to December 2001, three outbreaks of adenovirus (Ad) respiratory infection occurred in southern Taiwan. To determine the circulating serotypes and molecular epidemiology, a total of 524 virus strains were randomly selected from 1,064 strains isolated from 1981 to 2001, and were studied using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-RFLP. The major subgenus found was subgenus B (45\%), followed by subgenus E (29\%) and subgenus C (25\%). Ad3 and Ad7 were the major types found during the 1st outbreak, which occurred from November 1999 to March 2000, while Ad4 was found mainly during the 2nd and 3rd outbreaks in October 2000 and September 2001, respectively. Both Ad7 and Ad4 were reemerged serotypes, whereas Ad3 was consistently isolated during the survey, although it declined drastically from 36 to 2\% in 2001. Genotype analysis in this study showed that the only strain of Ad7 found in 1983 was Ad7a, but all randomly selected strains of Ad7 isolated during 1999\textendash{}2000 were Ad7b. The clinical features of 217 patients were analyzed during the 1999\textendash{}2000 outbreaks. About 79\% of the total cases were less than 7 years old. The ratio of male to female was 2:1. Severe infections, such as pneumonia and acute bronchitis, accounted for nearly half of the cases (43\%). These results show the reemergence and changing of serotypes, the clinical association of respiratory adenovirus infections, and the molecular epidemiology of Ad7 genotypes in Taiwan during the past two decades.

Partial hexon gene sequences obtained from the water samples were 100\% identical to the sequences obtained from the swab samples, which clustered with HAdV-4 within species E. Swimming pool water contaminated with HAdV-4 was the most likely source of infection, although one instance of likely person-to-person transmission was noted.},

This respiratory pathogen contains genome identity with chimpanzee adenoviruses, indicating zoonotic origins. A signature of these ``old'' HAdV-E4 is the absence of a critical replication motif, NF-I, which is found in all HAdV respiratory pathogens and most HAdVs. However, our recent survey of flu-like disease in children in Hong Kong reveals that the emergent HAdV-E4 pathogens circulating in civilian populations contain NF-I, indicating recombination and reflecting host-adaptation that enables the ``new'' HAdV-E4 to replicate more efficiently in human cells and foretells more potential HAdV-E4 outbreaks in immune-na{\"i}ve civilian populations. Special attention should be paid by clinicians to this emergent and recombinant HAdV-E4 circulating in civilian populations.},
